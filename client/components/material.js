        <div>First, and perhaps most important ones, we provide two datasets. The training dataset consists of a
        set of 50,000 raw images. The testing dataset consists of a subset of 5,000 (color) images
        compressed using the JPEG standard which some of those containing hidden data. The competitors
        should find which images contain hidden data, and which images donâ€™t.</div>,

        <div>We provide a set of scripts that have been used to convert the raw images into jpeg format. This
        python script uses library such as <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a> (version xx),
        &nbsp;<a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.1.x/">pillow</a> (version xx), ... and the open
        source software image manipulation software <a href="http://rawtherapee.com/">Rawtherapee</a>
        (version 5.4).
        Those scripts are those that we have used to generate the images from the testing dataset.</div>,

        <div>Eventually, we also provide the code of the embedding methods that have been used. Some are
        current-art embedding methods, such as J-UNIWARD and XXX while some are rather old and rusty
        steganographic schemes such as ns-F5 and ....
